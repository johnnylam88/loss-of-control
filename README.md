## Overview

[Loss Of Control][project] announces when you are suffering from a *Loss Of Control* event, e.g., stunned, silenced, spell-locked, etc., that prevents you from performing your role. When affected by several *Loss of Control* events at the same time, only the event that lasts the longest is announced.

**Loss of Control** will also show alerts for events from other members of the group that are also using the **Loss Of Control** addon.

## Features:

+ Make announcements in a choice of channels:
  + **Say** - Sends to */say*, visible to nearby characters.
  + **Yell** - Sends to */yell*, visible to not-so-nearby characters.
  + **Emote** - Sends to */em*, visible to nearby characters.
  + **Group** - Sends to */instance*, */battleground*, */raid*, or */party* depending on what is most appropriate.
+ Choose whether to enable announcements in Arenas, Battlegrounds, Dungeons, Raids, *Looking For Group* instances, or open world zones.
+ Choose the types of events to announce.
+ Only announce events that last longer than a user-settable number of seconds.
+ Optionally announce when you regain control.
+ Optionally announce only when in a group.
+ Control where alerts are shown when listening for *Loss Of Control* events from other members of the group.
